## 🌿 StillNotes – MVP UI Wireframes (Core Screens)

We'll sketch out 5 key screens that reflect your app's quiet and contemplative nature, while still being user-friendly and visually inviting.

### 1. 🏠 **Home / Dashboard**

> “Begin your day in stillness.”

**Elements:**
- Soft greeting (`Good morning, Ama 🙏`)
- “Start a New Note” button (CTA)
- “Your Recent Notes” (scrollable or card layout)
- “Gentle Reminder” (e.g. “You haven’t written since Tuesday. No pressure 😊”)
- Featured verse or quote of the day (optional)
- Bottom nav: 📝 Notes | 🔔 Reminders | 🔍 Discover | 👤 Profile


### 2. 📝 **Create Reflection Entry**

> “Write freely. Or just begin…”

**Layout:**
- Title field (optional)
- Rich text or markdown-enabled entry box (placeholder: *Today, I’m reflecting on…*)
- Optional Scripture/verse field
- Tags (e.g., *peace, trust, waiting*)
- Visibility toggle: `🔒 Private` | `🌤️ Public`
- Save button

> Option: Autosave drafts, emoji reactions toggle (quiet UI)


### 3. 📚 **Notes Library / Timeline**

> “Your journey, gently unfolding.”

**Display:**
- List or grid of previous entries (sorted by date)
- Filter by tag, mood, or scripture
- Quick preview: first few lines or excerpt
- Icons for favorite/starred entries
- Long press or tap to edit

Optional:
- “This day last year” flashback
- Calendar view toggle

### 4. 🔔 **Reminder & Soul Rhythm View**

> “You’ve revisited *‘Trust in the Silence’* 3 times this month.”

**Sections:**
- Timeline-based tracker (e.g., how often you've reflected)
- Gentle analytics (themes or verses repeated)
- Editable reminder preferences (time of day, frequency)
- Encouraging nudge message settings (e.g., “Just breathe and write.”)

This page should **feel light**, not like a metrics dashboard — maybe illustrated with waves, soft dots, or “soul glow” circles instead of charts.

### 5. 💬 **Public Feed / Discovery (optional for MVP)**

> “Notes shared from hearts like yours.”

**If included in MVP:**
- Waterfall or card-style feed of public entries
- Minimalist reactions (🙏 ❤️ 🌿) and short comment threads
- “Featured Reflections” or “Popular Verses”
- Option to follow a writer or save a public note to private library
