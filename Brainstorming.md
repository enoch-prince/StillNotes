## Background

Brainstorming a web app (which I don't have a name for yet😅) that helps individuals record a summary of their quiet time, devotion or even just a quote, so that they can refer to it for revision and allows others to react to and post comments on. Moreover, the app would send notifications of reminders to revise or go over the notes, quotes or devotional.

It's something between a *spiritual journal* and a *mini social-reflection space*.
